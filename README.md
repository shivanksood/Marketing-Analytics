### Dataset: Found it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation)

### Problem:

Elo, one of the largest payment brands in Brazil, has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key. The solution will improve customersâ€™ lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience for customers.


### Approach:

In the project, a two step approached was followed:
 1) Segmenting customers based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary factors.
 > RFM based on quartiles
 
 > RFM using K-means clustering
 
 2) Predicting winnable customer behavior to personalise promotions.
 
 > Prediction using XGBoost
